# Challenge-2

## My portfolio

Create my very own portfolio using HTML and CSS.

* You will see a hero when you enter the website(portfolio).
* You will see a nav section with about me, work, resume, and contact section. The nav allows users to jump to a section within my website when clicked.
* Under my work section, you will see two projects that I have done throughout my bootcamp career.
* When users click on the work section images, it will take them to the projects.
* Under the resume section, I added a "resume" button for users to click on when they want to see my resume.
* Under contact me section, I have my phone number and email so users can contact me if interested.
